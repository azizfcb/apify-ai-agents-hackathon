# Automate your Ghost CMS blogging using AI!

This agent allows you to create a new post in your Ghost CMS blog using AI (V4). The actor uses the OpenAI GPT-4o-mini model to transform or summarize a given input source and uses the ðŸ”— [Ghost Blog Poster on Apify](https://apify.com/azzouzana/ghost-blog-poster) tool ðŸš€.

To operate the agent, you need to:

- Set up the required environment variables for `ghost-blog-poster` **before** running the actor:
    - `GHOST_BASE_API_URL`: The base API URL of your Ghost blog (Format: `https://your-blog-domain/ghost/api/v4`).
    - `GHOST_ADMIN_API_KEY`: The admin API key for your Ghost blog, which can be found or created in the Ghost admin panel under **Integrations** (Format: `xxxxx:yyyyy`).
- Set your `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the agent's input.

## Input

The actor expects the following inputs:

- `pageUrlOrRawText` - string - the URL of the page or the raw text/HTML to summarize/reformulate
- `maxWords` - number - the maximum number of words to generate. Default is `500`

Note that the blog post would be saved as a `draft` by default.

## Output

Successful post creation will return a similar output:
`A draft post has been created successfully. You can view it [here](https://your-blog-domain/p/e9ff44d6-ffe6-4ef2-9e11-6787e50c407f/).`
